This directory contains all the files necessary to run an example optimization run based on planet bearing L10 reliability:

1) rblo.py contains the module for planet bearing force and L10 calculation
2) example_rblo.py contains the specific drivetrain and optimization parameters that customize the optimization problem

To use this example, modify paths to fit your directory organization, then run example_rblo.py. The output of running this example are optimized layouts (the number being equal to the number of seeds the user specifies).
