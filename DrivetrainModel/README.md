This directory contains all the files you need to calculate planet bearing forces and L10 life from an output ASCII FAST.Farm file. This directory does not contain any optimization tools, and is instead meant to isolate the L10 calculation used in the reliability-based design optimization code. For optimization, refer to the optimization folder. 

You will need the drivetrain.py file, which contains all classes and functions to calculate planet bearing forces and speeds, and the corresponding L10 life of the bearings. The Calc_L10.py file calls those classes and functions and plots the forces on the bearing. The Case_A_8.txt file contains sample data file from FAST.Farm which will provide the basis for the life calculation.

There are a few equations referenced in the code, which come from these sources:
